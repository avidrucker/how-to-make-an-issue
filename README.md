# Quick Guide to Creating Issues on GitHub

## 1. Introduction
- GitHub Issues are a great way to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs for projects.
- Issues are like a to-do list for your repository.
- This guide will show you how to create and manage issues on GitHub.

> Note: You can create issues for your own projects as well as other people/organization's projects

## 2. Access The GitHub "Repo" You Want to Create Issues For
- Make sure you have a GitHub account. Sign up [here](https://github.com/join) if you haven't.
- Navigate to the GitHub repository where you want to create an issue.

> If you don't already have a repo but want to work on your own, you will first need to [create a new repo on GitHub](#) (coming soon...).

## 3. Open the Issues Tab
- From the repository page, find the "Issues" tab near the top of the page and click on it.
- Here you can see a list of the current GitHub repo issues

## 4. Create a New Issue
- Click on the “New Issue” button.
- You'll see a form to fill out.

## 5. Write Your Issue
- **Title:** Give your issue a clear, concise title. This helps others understand what the issue is about at a glance.
- **Comment:** Describe the issue in detail. Include specifics like:
  - What you're trying to achieve.
  - Steps to reproduce the problem.
  - Expected vs. actual results.
  - Any error messages.
- **Enhancements:** If it’s a feature request, explain why this feature would be useful.

## 6. Use Labels, Assignees, and Projects (Optional)
- **Labels:** Categorize your issue (like bug, enhancement, question).
- **Assignees:** If you want specific people to work on the issue, assign them.
- **Projects:** If you are using GitHub Projects, you can add this issue to a specific project.

## 7. Submit the Issue
- Once done, click on “Submit new issue.”
- Your issue will now be visible to others in the repository.

## 8. Managing and Closing Issues
- You can comment on issues, close them when resolved, or update them as needed.
- To close an issue, click on the “Close issue” button at the bottom of the issue discussion.
